        <p style="font-size: 20px;">One of the dishes I request most often when I visit my parents' house is tortang talong, an eggplant cooked whole, peeled, flattened with a fork, dipped in egg, and shallow-fried until golden brown. 
            Growing up, my mom preferred roasting the eggplant, 
            and what would arrive at the table was a study in contrasting textures and flavors: 
            the naturally sweet roasted eggplant offset by the salty seasoning, the soft, creamy flesh encased in the crisp fried exterior. </p>\

        <ul>
            <li>4 medium Japanese eggplant (about 1 1/2 pounds; 680g total)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) plus 3/4 cup (175ml) vegetable oil, divided, plus extra as needed</li>
            <li> 1 medium garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>8 ounces (225g) ground pork </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) oyster sauce  </li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (8ml) fish sauce </li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (8ml) soy sauce </li>
            <li>5 large eggs (250g), divided</li>
            <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
            <li>Ketchup or banana ketchup, for serving</li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
            <p style="font-size: 25px ;">Directions</p>
            
            <p>Step 1</p>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350째F (177째C). With the tip of a sharp knife, 
                poke four 1/2-inch slits in each eggplant. Place eggplant on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil and roast until fully tender, 
                offering little to no resistance when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. 
                Set aside until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. </li>
            
            <p>Step 2</p>
                <li> Peel eggplant, leaving stems attached; discard skin. With the back of a fork, 
                press down firmly to flatten each eggplant along its length until it resembles a large teardrop in shape; set aside. </li>
           
            <p>Step 3</p>  
                  <li>In a 12-inch stainless steel, cast iron, or nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil over medium-high heat. 
                Add onion and garlic, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Add ground pork and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up any large pieces, until cooked through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
                 Add oyster sauce, fish sauce, and soy sauce and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute. 
                Remove skillet from heat, and set aside to let cool slightly. </li>
            
            <p>Step 4</p>
                <li> In a medium bowl, beat 3 eggs until homogenous and frothy. Add ground pork mixture and stir to combine; set aside. In a wide, shallow dish,
                 beat remaining 2 eggs until homogenous and frothy, season with salt and pepper, and set aside. Clean skillet and return to stovetop. </li>
           
            <step>Step 5</step>
                 <li> Adjust oven temperature to 200째F (95째C). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and line with a double layer of paper towels. 
                In the cleaned skillet, heat 3/4 cup (175ml) vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working with one eggplant at a time, 
                hold eggplant by stem, and evenly coat on all sides with beaten egg mixture. Allow excess egg to drip off, and carefully add to skillet.
                 Repeat coating process with second eggplant and add to skillet. Top each eggplant with a heaping 1/4 cup (60g) of ground pork mixture, 
                 evenly pressing mixture down along the length of each eggplant to ensure it adheres to the surface. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, 
                 until bottom side is golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes.
                 Using a slotted spatula, carefully flip eggplant and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, about 1 minute 30 seconds.  </li>
           
            <step>Step 6</step>
                <li> Transfer eggplant to prepared baking sheet, then transfer to oven to keep warm. 
                Repeat coating and cooking process with remaining eggplant, adding more oil to skillet as needed. </li>
            
            <step>Step 7</step>
                <li> Transfer to individual plates and serve immediately with white rice and ketchup. </li>
        </ol>
